Inheritance:
Child class inherits from base class and may have additional properties also.	

What if in child class you wanna use constructor of super class. 
Here comes a method 'super'. It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor. 
* super directly points to the above class

What if there are methods or properties that should only be limited in base class?
Here comes private 'keyword'. It restricts the visibility of a variable or method within a class.

Box box5 = Boxweight();
When a reference have type of super class, it can only access to super class members. 

Boxweight box6 =Box(); "error"
because parent don't knows what classes are below, however, below classes knows what classes are above.

Types Of Inheritance
1- Single Inheritance
Box->BoxWeight 
2- Multiple Inheritance
Java don't support this as 2 parents might have same members. Well here comes our interfaces that just make a copy of template
3- Multi-level classes
4- Hierarchical Inheritance
Similar to Single Inheritance one class will be extracted to different classes
5- Hybrid Inheritance
A->B+C, B+C->D
